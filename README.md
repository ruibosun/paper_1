COVID-19 Cases in Toronto

This paper is for the COVID-19 Cases in Toronto and factors of mortality rate.

It examines the mortality rate difference between male and female COVID-19 patients in Canada from 2020 to 2023, taking into account the im- pact of new virus variants. Using data from Ontarioâ€™s national Case & Contact Management System, the study will present findings using data visualization tools and update previous findings that showed higher mortality rates in male patients. The study will also examine other variables that may impact mortality rate and address the knowledge gap between current COVID-19 variants and previous stud- ies. The authors will explain the limitations of the data, including the possibility of missing cases due to a lack of testing or symptoms.
